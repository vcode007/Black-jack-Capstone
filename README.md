# Black-jack-Capstone
Welcome to the Blackjack game! This project contains implementation of a text-based Blackjack game written in Python:
A realistic deck generated using card ranks and suits.
Robust card handling through dedicated functions (e.g., get_rank()) to accurately extract card values (especially for multi-character ranks like "10").
A more modular design with improved game flow.
Realistic dealer behavior, including revealing only the dealer's first card (with its score) during gameplay.
